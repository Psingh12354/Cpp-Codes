/*A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 
More formally a Graph can be defined as,
There are two type of edges:
1> directed grapg(digraph) eg : u to v and v to u
n(n-1)
2> undirected eg : u and v
n(n-1)/2
eg : social networking undirected
eg : www is directed graph
